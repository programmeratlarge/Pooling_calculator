# Pooling_calculator

A utility that helps design Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) library pools so that each library contributes the desired number of molecules to a shared sequencing run. In practice, it takes per-library concentration and size information and converts that into precise pipetting volumes, ensuring that the final pool is equimolar (or otherwise “weighted” according to user-defined targets) across all samples.
