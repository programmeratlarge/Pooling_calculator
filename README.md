# Pooling calculator

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) library pooling utility that calculates precise pipetting volumes to achieve equimolar (or weighted) pooling across samples. The calculator takes per-library concentration and fragment length data and computes volumes needed so each library contributes the desired number of molecules to the final sequencing pool.

The project focuses on advanced sub-pool management, allowing users to combine pre-pooled sample groups while preserving equal representation across all underlying samples. This is critical for high-plex experiments where dozens or hundreds of libraries need balanced read depth.
